A neat little script a wrote to remind me to do my reviews.

## Setup
1. Generate a new token [here](https://www.wanikani.com/settings/personal_access_tokens). It does not need any special permissions.
2. replace `YOUR_V2_TOKEN-HERE` in the script with your token.
3. install the dependencies in requirements.txt
4. put it in the Windows task sceduler. I have it set to run once upon logon and I am using pythonw to run it as it does not open a console. (see below for reference)
